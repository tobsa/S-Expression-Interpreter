    S-Expression Interpreter
    ========================
    
    This is basically a calculator implemented by s-expressions. This allows for quite complex expressions.
    
    ----------
    
    Operations supported: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. In addition parantheses and 
    variables are supported.
    
    Usage example:
    
    ==> fx = 5          // Create the variable fx and set it to 5
    5
    ==> fx + fx         // Add them together
    10
    ==> (g = fx) + 5 + (h = 3) // Create the variable g and assign fx to it. Create the variable h and assign 3 to it.
